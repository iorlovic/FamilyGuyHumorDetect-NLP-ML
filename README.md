Abstract:
Our project explores methods to analyze and rank the humor content in the show “Family Guy” using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The primary objectives are to determine the funniest seasons and episodes, understand the nature and length of jokes, assess appropriateness for children, and compare text-based humor detection with video/sound detection. Sentiment analysis tools such as VADER and keyword-based sentiment scoring are employed to provide a nuanced understanding of humor in dialogues. The study also delves into the use of linguistic patterns and clustering to identify characteristics of humorous content.
